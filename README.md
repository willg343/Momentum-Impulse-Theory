# Momentum-Impulse-Theorem
This is a partial Momentum Impulse Theorem visualizer, focusing on the momentum that an object gains before a collision. By varying the speed and mass of it we observe the different behaviour of the ball, considering that the impulse value remains constant.
Serving a purpose of an Advanced Physics 111 wrap-up project for the Energy unit.
